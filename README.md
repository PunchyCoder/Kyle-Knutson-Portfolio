Portfolio of my work as a Full Stack Web Developer 
WIP/Under Construction

really had trouble figuring out the responsive/viewport and tags for some reason. (because I still need practice..duh)

The layout looks pretty good to me. 
I shouldn't have spent so much time on the logo pixel art.. 
I still need to get the wide-view layout.
The Nav turned out like I hoped, thank God, lol.
